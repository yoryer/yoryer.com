          Hi there! My name is Jorge Noguera and I’m a software engineer based
          in Paraguay.
        </p>
        <p>
          My professional journey started in 2008 when I joined a company as a
          web developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later in my career I have the opportunity to work as an Android mobile
          developer and more recently I was focused on hybrid mobile development
          using Flutter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve also worked on more performance oriented software like building
          API’s or scripts for SMS Premium services.
        </p>
        <p>Occasionally I do some graphic design.</p>
